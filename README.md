# Uncertainties Neural Networks

A notebook that implements a simple CNN classifier to test uncertainties estimation of Neural Network.
Two methods are explored in the associated notebook:

- Monte Carlo Dropout : method theorized and explained in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf (Gal 2016)
- Assumed Dense Filtering : inspired by Gast et al. article https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11327

The code of ADF's function (contrib folder) is provided by Mattia Seg√π and available @ https://github.com/mattiasegu/uncertainty_estimation_deep_learning
